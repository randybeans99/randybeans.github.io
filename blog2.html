<p class="p1">The great big list of Mental Models</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">mental models are a framework for decision making. They allow you to multiply in a world that can only add. They give you a distinct advantage over others, allow you to make better decisions and allow you to win at life!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>CONFIRMATION BIAS</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">We look for things that confirm that we&rsquo;re right instead of looking for reasons as to why we&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>INCENTIVES</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How and why people do things.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>OCCAM&rsquo;S RAZOR</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The simplest explanation is the most likely to be true. Less variables = less chance for something to be wrong.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>HANLON&rsquo;S RAZOR</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Don&rsquo;t attribute to malice that which can easily be attributed to stupidity. I.E people are probably not being malicious, they&rsquo;re just making mistakes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>THIRD STORY</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Each argument will have at least two stories. Person A has his argument, Person B has her argument. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Imagine there was a third Person, Person C standing there watching, what would they think?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>PARETO PRINCIPLE</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Also known as the 80/20 rule. For example, 80% of the wealth of a nation is held by 20% of the people. 20% of the clothes in your wardrobe are worn 80% of the time. etc&hellip;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The point at which the return for you effort starts to decrease relative to what you gain out of it. For example, when you start learning a new subject, you learn a lot quickly as there is much to learn. However, as you get closer to mastery, you have to put in much more effort just to pick up the final 10% of the subject.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another example is eating, when you eat fast food the first bite is amazing, but by bite number ten, it doesn&rsquo;t feel as good anymore.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Is a term popularised by legendary investor Warren Buffett. Basically says only operate in things that you truly understand and avoid those that you do not. Only play games where you have the advantage, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The less you know about something, the more likely you are to wrong choices and mistakes, leading to failure. So it&rsquo;s important to know and understand what your areas of expertise are and where they lie. I.E your Circle of Competence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>MURPHY&rsquo;S LAW</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If you make that assumption, then you&rsquo;ll be much more prepared for the unlikely scenarios where things do go wrong. You&rsquo;ll be more prepared to deal with it and will be more likely to succeed in your endeavor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For example, you need to be at work for 09:00, it takes 20 minutes to get there, but with Murphy&rsquo;s Law, your car probably won&rsquo;t start, you&rsquo;ll forget something and leave it in the house, and there will be traffic on the way there, so you&rsquo;ll prepare for it by giving yourself 40 minutes to get to work. This is similar to the <span class="s1"><strong>Margin of Safety</strong></span> mental model.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>MARGIN OF SAFETY</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;mean regression</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;network effects</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;game theory</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;probablistic thinking</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;frame of reference</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;anchoring</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;paradigm shift</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;proximate cause / root cause</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;postmortem<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;5 why&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;framing</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;veil of ignorance</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;herd immunity</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp;tragedy of the commons</p>
<p class="p1">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>SECOND ORDER THINKING</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
