<p class = "blogNav">Contrarianism</p>

<p> A contrarian can be defined as someone who opposes or rejects popular opinion. It is commonly used in the world of business but can be applied elsewhere also. A contrarian may not follow the latest fashion trends or have the new designer ‘specs’. They do their own thing. </p>

<p> Being this way can have both advantages and disadvantages. In business, sometimes it can become a huge advantage. You are able to avoid echo chambers, the filter bubble or groupthink. This means you are able to make your own decisions, based on your own observations, maybe by using the scientific method, to come to conclusions that you believe to be true.
Instead of, making decisions based on what other people are thinking, maybe unconsciously, through things like the bandwagon effect or the Conformity bias or consciously through the desire to fit in and be liked by your peers. </p>

<p> As the old saying goes, “if you do what everyone else does, you’ll get what everyone else has got.” </p>

<p> If you want average results follow the crowd, if you want exceptional results find a new path. </p>

<p> By it’s very definition average is the middle. Something that most people achieve. So if you do what everyone else does, you’ll probably do ok, not exceptional but not bad. But who want’s to be just ok? Who I want to live an ‘average’ existence. I don’t want to achieve much. I certainly do not feel that way. </p>

<p> In investment terms, if you want to achieve the greatest results, you need to be right when the consensus is wrong. </p>

<p> If you’re both right, you’ll get average results. <br>
	If they’re right and your wrong, you’ll get very poor results. <br>
	If you’re both wrong, you’ll both get very poor results. <br>
	If you’re right and they’re wrong you’ll get exceptional results. </p>

<p> You want to be in the top percentile! You want to be in the right side of the bell curve distribution. However, you will absoulety need to develop a thick skin. It takes a lot of confidence and belief in yourself to stand against the consensus and they may come down hard on you. It may even result in a paradigm shift. There are many biases that we can all fall prey to, including the established opinions. </p>
